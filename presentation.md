- Legacy payment systems
- Clearing & settlement costs & counterparty risks
- Financial inclusion (1 billion people underbanked)

### Financial Sector Issues with Blockchain Technology

  - No need for a native currency
  - Distributed database technology
- Permissionless blockchains (public)
  - Unknown participants
  - Security based on incentives
  - Native currency
  - Crypto-economics
